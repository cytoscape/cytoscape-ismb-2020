## ISMB 2020

### Cytoscape Ecosystem Tutorial: JavaScript

To run this tutorial follow these steps:

1. Make sure Cytoscape is installed and running.
2. Clone or download this repository or download and unzip a copy of this example to its own directory. Downloads are available [here](https://github.com/cytoscape/ismb2020/tree/master/JavaScript/dist).
3. Open the `ismb-2020-webpage-example` by either:
  - Opening the `index.html` file in your web browser.
  - Using a web-server, such as python's http.server. This will behave more like an actual web page would, and is more useful for web development. To do this, open a terminal, go to the example directory, and use the following command:`sudo python3 -m http.server 80`. In your web browser go to `localhost`. 

After these steps, the tutorial text should appear in your web browser, and you will be ready to follow the included instructions there.
